# Number Conversion

Windows app to convert from and to different number systems.

This is the best-effort attempt at number conversion up to 128 bits.

Signed & Unsigned Integers, Single, Double, Binary, Octal, Hex values.

An open mind and some knowledge of number systems, hopefully binary, is required in order to understand the displayed values.

Possibly of good use to those who are dealing with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and different data types.

# Functionality
All the displayed values revolve around the binary representation and/or integer promotion/demotion, with the following logic being used:

- 128-bit = 2 x 64-bit = 4 x 32-bit = 8 x 16-bit = 16 x 8-bit ... 64-bit = 2 x 32-bit = 4 x 16-bit = 8 x 8-bit ... etc
- Any number will be looked at with the required number of bits for the data type of the display:
  - For example, if you select Int64 then the binary will show 64 bits regardless of what valid number from the 64-bit range you enter
  - All other data types that have that same number within their own range will then display it as such
  - All other data types that don't have that same number within their own range will then display multiple values with each value representing the number of bytes required for their own data type and extracted from the binary representation of the original number
- The required number of bits will be achieved by either splitting the original bits into groups or extending it while observing the sign
- The weight of all the displayed values is `Hi <----> Lo`.

Floating-point numbers are somewhat special and that's why they are in their own section
- Floating-point binary format is: Sign bit - Exponent bits - Fraction bits (ex.: 32-bit = 1-8-23 ; 64-bit = 1-11-52)
- Floating-point equivalent integer representation is packed into the BigInteger number
- Floating-point equivalent integer representation observes only the Integral part and disregards the Fractional part of the number
- If you want to use the BYTE logic for floating-point numbers then you will have to perform 2 conversions, here is an example:
  - Select `Float32` data type, enter number "1.2241" and then check its representation under `BinaryF32`, which should show the following:
   - `0 01111111 00111001010111101001111` which is Sign bit - Exponent bits - Fraction bits representation
   - This is 32 bits so it can be looked at as 4 bytes (4 groups of 8 bits)
  - Right click and copy this binary number
  - Switch to `Binary` data type, right click and paste the number, hit `Convert` button or just press Enter
  - Now you can see how those 4 bytes are interpreted by integer data types, ex. `Int8` will show "63, -100, -81, 79" while `Int32` will show "1067233103"
  - Also, the floating-point numbers section now shows a representation of "1067233103" and not the number "1.2241" we started with
 
# Build
All it takes is to:

- Download and install Visual Studio community edition (ideally 2019).
- Download and extract the zip file of this project.
- Open this as an existing project in Visual Studio and, on the menu, do:
  - Build/Build Solution (or press Ctrl-Shift-B).
  - Debug/Start Debugging (or press F5) to run the app.
- Locate created EXE file in the /bin/Debug folder and copy it over to your preferred folder or Desktop.
